# 🐉 Dragon Sneeze

This project features an interactive 3D animation of a dragon that "sneezes" or "breathes fire" based on user interaction. It's a fun demonstration of **Three.js** for 3D rendering and **GSAP** for animations.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The core of this project is a Three.js scene displaying a stylized dragon. Users can interact by clicking (or tapping) and holding to "charge" the dragon's sneeze. Releasing the click triggers the sneeze animation, including wing flapping, head movements, and particle effects for smoke and fire.

• **Interactive 3D Dragon** — A charming 3D dragon model built with basic Three.js geometries  
• **Dynamic Animations** — Smooth, time-based animations using GreenSock (GSAP)  
• **Sneeze/Fire Breathing Mechanics** — User input controls the intensity of the sneeze  
• **Smoke and Fire Particles** — Particle system enhances the sneeze/fire effect  
• **Responsive Design** — Adapts to different window sizes  
• **Orbit Controls** — Rotate the camera around the dragon
